    I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
    I knew he must a been about seventeen
    The beat was goin' strong
    Playin' my favorite song
    An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
    Till he was with me, yeah me
    And I could tell it wouldn't be long
    Till he was with me, yeah me, singin'
    I love rock n' roll
    So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
    I love rock n' roll
    So come and take your time and dance with me
    Ow!
    He smiled so I got up and asked for his name
    That don't matter, he said
    'Cause it's all the same
    Said can I take you home where we can be alone
    An' next we were movin' on
    He was with me, yeah me
    Next we were movin' on
    He was with me, yeah me, singin'
    I love rock n' roll
    So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
    I love rock n' roll
    So come an' take your time an' dance with me
    Ow!
    Said can I take you home where we can be alone
    Next we were movin' on
    He was with me, yeah me
    An we'll be movin' on
    An' singin' that same old song
    Yeah with me, singin'
    I love rock n' roll
    So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
    I love rock n' roll
    So come an' take your time an' dance with me
